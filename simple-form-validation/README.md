### Task
You are given a simple login form HTML. Add Javascript to make the following validations when a user submits the form:
- The email input should contain the `@`` character. 
- The password length should be at least 8 characters.


### Additional Requirements
- In case of an email or password validation error, display the error message on the appropriate HTML element (check the HTML code)
- Disable the default form submission behavior (auto refresh). Try to search on the internet how to do that.
